# NumberGuessing
The Number Guessing Game in Java is designed for players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game initiates with the program selecting a random number, and players are prompted to input their guesses. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues in a loop until the player successfully guesses the number, at which point a congratulatory message is displayed along with the number of attempts made by the player. Key components include random number generation, user input, feedback provision, a game loop, and tracking of the number of attempts. This basic structure can be customized to suit specific preferences or extended with additional features as desired.
